# Go-Utils
Various simple go scripts and tools, which hopefully may help to reduce the effort to develop go applications...

## Dev Scripts
These short scripts may be an alternative to fullblown solutions like "github.com/cosmtrek/air" package.
\
You will have to install "inotify-tools" for your linux distribution. e.g. 
- sudo apt-get install inotify-tools
- sudo dnf install inotify-tools
\
Just put the script in the root-dir of your project and efor example run:
- *dev-run*: `./dev-run src/my_app.go`
